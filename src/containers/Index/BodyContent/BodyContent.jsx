        Hey there
        <Emoji symbol=" 👋🏼" label="waving hand" />
        , thanks for taking the time to visit my photography portfolio.
        My name is Brett Oberg, and in my spare time I take photos.
        I am inspired by nature and I use photography as an excuse to experience its beauty.
        Photography has helped give direction and purpose to my life, and I hope my images
        inspire you to go out and find what is special for you.

      <Typography variant="body1" gutterBottom>
        Aside from developing software (like this website), I spend my time taking photos, cycling,
        golfing, playing tennis, and spending time with family. I hope you enjoy my work and would
        like to collaborate on a project or chat over coffee
        <Emoji symbol=" ☕️" label="hot beverage" />
